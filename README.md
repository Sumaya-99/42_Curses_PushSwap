#42_Curses_PushSwap

Project Overview: 42_Curses_PushSwap

The project mandate involved implementing a sorting algorithm to arrange a set of numbers within a specified number of moves, 

aiming to minimize the required movements as outlined by the project guidelines. 

I employed the Mechanical Turk algorithm utilizing a single linked list data structure to accomplish this task efficiently.

As an additional challenge, the bonus component entailed replicating the functionality of the provided checker program within the subject. 

This program evaluates whether the numbers have been sorted correctly. Upon successful sorting, it outputs "OK"; otherwise, it displays "KO".
